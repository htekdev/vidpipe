## TikTok

### Recommended Frequency

- **Optimal:** 2–5 posts/week (Buffer data from 11M+ posts)
- **Growth tier:** 1–4 posts/day for aggressive growth
- **Key insight:** Going from 1 to 2–5 posts/week delivers up to **17% more views per post** — the biggest ROI jump. Posting 6–10/week lifts views ~29%, 11+/week ~34%, but gains taper off.
- **TikTok's own recommendation:** 1–4 times per day

### Best Content Types

| Format | Performance | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Short video (15–60s)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Core format. 15–30s is the sweet spot for retention |
| **Medium video (60–180s)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Good for tutorials, deeper topics. Growing format |
| **Long video (3–10min)** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Supported but lower completion rates |
| **Text-only** | ❌ | Not supported — video is required |
| **Images/carousels** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Photo carousels now available, gaining traction |

### Video Specifications

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Aspect ratio | **9:16** (vertical, full screen) |
| Resolution | **1080 × 1920 px** |
| Max file size | 287 MB (mobile), 4 GB (web) |
| Duration | 15s–10min (15–60s recommended) |
| Format | MP4, MOV |
| Captions | **Critical** — 80%+ of TikTok is watched with sound, but captions boost accessibility and retention |

### What Works

- Authentic, unpolished content outperforms overproduced videos
- Hook in the first 1–3 seconds is essential (algo measures watch-through rate)
- Trending sounds boost discoverability but aren't required
- Text overlays and captions increase watch time
- Posting during peak hours (7–9 AM, 12–3 PM, 7–11 PM local) helps initial velocity

### What to Avoid

- Horizontal video (gets letterboxed, looks bad)
- Watermarks from other platforms (algorithmically suppressed)
- Content without a clear hook — viewers scroll past in <1 second

---

## YouTube

### Recommended Frequency

- **Long-form video:** 1 per week (Buffer, Dexxter Clark study)
- **YouTube Shorts:** 1–3 per week (Buffer); 3–5 high-value Shorts/week (ContHunt 2026 data)
- **Key insight:** Daily uploads are the fastest growth strategy, but 1/week vs. 3/week vs. 5/day showed no significant engagement difference per video (Dexxter Clark). Consistency matters more than volume.
- **YouTube Creators channel:** Upload as much as realistically possible, but stick to a schedule

### Best Content Types

| Format | Performance | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Shorts (< 60s, vertical)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Separate algorithm, massive discovery potential |
| **Long-form (8–20min)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Best for subscriber growth and watch time |
| **Medium (2–8min)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Good for tutorials, mid-depth topics |
| **Community posts** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Text/image/poll posts to engage existing subscribers |
| **Premieres** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Live chat during debut drives engagement |

### Video Specifications

| Spec | Shorts | Long-form |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Aspect ratio | **9:16** | **16:9** |
| Resolution | **1080 × 1920 px** | **1920 × 1080 px** (minimum) |
| Max file size | — | 256 GB |
| Duration | **< 60 seconds** | Up to 12 hours |
| Format | MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV | MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV |
| Captions | Burn-in recommended | SRT upload or auto-generated |

### What Works

- Thumbnails are critical for long-form CTR (bright, high-contrast, faces)
- First 30 seconds determine retention — front-load value
- Chapters (timestamps) improve watch time and SEO
- Shorts can drive subscribers to long-form content (cross-promotion)
- Posting on Wed 9AM–4PM EST and Fri 12–5PM EST shows highest engagement
- Shorts peak on weekdays 2–4 PM and weekend mornings 9–11 AM

### What to Avoid

- Inconsistent upload schedule (algorithm penalizes gaps)
- Shorts over 60 seconds (won't be classified as Shorts)
- Misleading thumbnails (hurts retention and algorithm trust)
- Ignoring the first 30 seconds — viewers decide quickly

---

## Instagram

### Recommended Frequency

- **Feed posts (Reels, carousels, images):** 3–5 per week (Buffer data)
- **Stories:** 1–3 per day
- **Reels:** 3–5 per week
- **Key insight:** Moving from 1–2 posts/week to 3–5 delivers **+12% more reach per post**. 6–9/week gives +18%, 10+/week gives +24%, but diminishing returns.
- **Follower growth:** 3–5 posts/week = +0.26% growth rate; 10+/week = +0.66%

### Best Content Types

| Format | Performance | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Reels (15–90s video)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highest reach and discovery. Algorithm priority |
| **Carousels** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highest saves and shares. "Mini-blogs" format |
| **Stories** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Engagement and authenticity. Disappear in 24h |
| **Single images** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Still work but lower reach than Reels/carousels |
| **Long-form video (IGTV)** | ⭐⭐ | Supported but Reels dominate discovery |
| **Text-only** | ❌ | Not supported — visual content required |

### Video Specifications

| Spec | Reels | Feed Video | Stories |
|------|-------|------------|---------|
| Aspect ratio | **9:16** | **4:5** or 1:1 | **9:16** |
| Resolution | **1080 × 1920 px** | **1080 × 1350 px** | **1080 × 1920 px** |
| Max duration | 90 seconds | 60 seconds | 60 seconds |
| Format | MP4, MOV | MP4, MOV | MP4, MOV |
| Captions | Burn-in recommended | Auto or burn-in | Text overlays |

### What Works

- Reels are the #1 discovery format — algorithm pushes them to non-followers
- Carousels drive the highest saves (educational content)
- Consistent posting schedule beats sporadic bursts
- Algorithm rewards watch time, saves, and shares over likes
- Vertical (9:16) and 4:5 outperform square and landscape
- User-generated content and behind-the-scenes perform well

### What to Avoid

- Posting the same Reel as TikTok with a watermark (algorithmically suppressed)
- Overposting (more than 1 feed post/day risks engagement splitting)
- Low-quality images (algorithm favors high-res visuals)
- Ignoring Stories — they keep you top-of-mind with existing followers

---

## LinkedIn

### Recommended Frequency

- **Optimal:** 2–5 posts/week (LinkedIn's official recommendation; Buffer data from 2M+ posts)
- **Growth tier:** 6–10 posts/week pushes reach higher; 11+/week nearly **3× engagements per post** vs. 1/week
- **Key insight:** Moving from 1 to 2–5 posts/week is the turning point where LinkedIn starts distributing content more widely. Members posting 2×/week see **5× more profile views**.
- **Spacing:** 12–18 hours between posts prevents engagement splitting

### Best Content Types

| Format | Performance | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Text posts (long-form)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Thought leadership, stories, insights. LinkedIn's native strength |
| **Document carousels (PDF)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Highest engagement. Swipeable educational content |
| **Native video** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Growing format. Autoplay in feed catches attention |
| **Polls** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good for engagement but lower reach |
| **Articles** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Long-form content, SEO benefits, newsletter integration |
| **Image posts** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Single or multi-image. Infographics perform well |
| **External links** | ⭐⭐ | Algorithm deprioritizes posts with outbound links |

### Video Specifications

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Aspect ratio | **1:1** (square) or **16:9** (landscape) |
| Resolution | **1080 × 1080 px** (square) or **1920 × 1080 px** (landscape) |
| Max file size | 5 GB |
| Duration | 3 seconds–10 minutes (30–90s recommended for engagement) |
| Format | MP4 |
| Captions | **Essential** — most users scroll with sound off |

### What Works

- LinkedIn posts have **2–3 week shelf life** (much longer than other platforms)
- Algorithm shifted from likes to **meaningful conversations** (comment quality matters)
- **Dwell time** (how long people read your post) is a key ranking signal
- Expertise signals: posting consistently on specific topics builds authority
- First 60–90 minutes (Golden Hour) determine distribution
- Personal stories and lessons learned outperform promotional content
- Questions that spark discussion drive comments

### What to Avoid

- Engagement bait ("Like if you agree!") — algorithmically penalized
- External links in the post body (put them in comments instead)
- More than 1 post per day (engagement splitting)
- Generic corporate messaging — authenticity wins
- Posting on weekends (significantly lower engagement for B2B audiences)

### Content Strategy for vidpipe

LinkedIn is the platform where **medium-clip videos (60–180s)** shine. Our pipeline generates medium clips with captions — these are ideal for LinkedIn's professional audience who want substantive content without committing to a full video. Text-only posts for shorts and long-form are also generated but go without media attachment.

---

## X (Twitter)

### Recommended Frequency

- **Optimal:** 3–5 posts/day (Buffer, EverywhereMarketer study of 30 top accounts)
- **Personal accounts:** 3–4 posts/day
- **Business accounts:** 3–5 posts/day
- **Creator accounts:** 4–7 posts/day (max safe limit: 7/day before reach drops)
- **Key insight:** X's timeline is fast-moving and strongly influenced by recency. The algorithm prioritizes newer posts, so posting once/day disappears quickly. Spreading posts across the day gives more chances to appear in different timelines.

### Best Content Types

| Format | Performance | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Text tweets** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Core format. Hot takes, insights, threads |
| **Threads** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Multi-tweet narratives. High engagement and shares |
| **Short video (< 2:20)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Autoplay in feed. Growing format |
| **Images** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Infographics, screenshots, memes |
| **Polls** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Quick engagement drivers |
| **Quote tweets** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Adding commentary to others' posts |
| **Long-form articles** | ⭐⭐ | Premium feature, limited audience |

### Video Specifications

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Aspect ratio | **16:9** (landscape) or **9:16** (vertical) |
| Resolution | **1280 × 720 px** (landscape) or **720 × 1280 px** (vertical) |
| Max file size | 512 MB |
| Max duration | **2 minutes 20 seconds** |
| Format | MP4 |
| Captions | **Always add** — most scrolling is with sound off |

### What Works

- **Engagement velocity** matters most — early interactions signal the algorithm
- Mix of original posts, replies, and reshares keeps account visible
- Posting during peak windows: 8–12 AM and 5–6 PM, especially Tue–Wed
- Threads perform exceptionally well for storytelling and education
- Bold positioning and authentic voice outperform corporate speak
- Hashtags are less important than on other platforms (1–2 max)

### What to Avoid

- More than 7 posts/day (risks shadowbanning and reduced reach)
- Posting only links without commentary
- Ignoring replies — X rewards conversation participation
- Same-format monotony — mix text, video, images, threads

### Content Strategy for vidpipe

X is a **high-frequency, text-forward platform**. Short video clips (< 2:20) with captions work well but text posts with key insights can drive just as much engagement. Our pipeline generates short clips and medium clips with video attachments, giving X a mix of media and text content across the day.

## Cross-Platform Content Repurposing

One of vidpipe's core strengths is generating platform-specific variants from a single recording. Here's how content maps across platforms:

### Short Clips (15–60s)

| Platform | Variant | Aspect Ratio | Captions |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| TikTok | `tiktok` (9:16) | 9:16 | Burned in |
| YouTube Shorts | `youtube-shorts` (9:16) | 9:16 | Burned in |
| Instagram Reels | `instagram-reels` (9:16) | 9:16 | Burned in |
| X | Original (no variant) | 16:9 or 9:16 | Burned in |
| LinkedIn | ❌ Text-only | N/A | N/A |

### Medium Clips (60–180s)

| Platform | Variant | Aspect Ratio | Captions |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| TikTok | `tiktok` (9:16) | 9:16 | Burned in |
| YouTube | Original (16:9) | 16:9 | Burned in |
| Instagram | Original (16:9) | 16:9 | Burned in |
| LinkedIn | Original (16:9) | 16:9 | Burned in |
| X | Original (16:9) | 16:9 | Burned in |

### Long-form Video

| Platform | Variant | Aspect Ratio | Captions |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| YouTube | Original (16:9) | 16:9 | Burned in |
| Instagram | Original (16:9) | 16:9 | Burned in |
| LinkedIn | ❌ Text-only | N/A | N/A |
| TikTok | ❌ Not scheduled | N/A | N/A |
| X | ❌ Not scheduled | N/A | N/A |

## Our Schedule vs. Recommendations

| Platform | Recommended | Our Schedule | Status |
|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **TikTok** | 2–5 posts/week | 3 shorts + 1 medium = 4/day | ⚠️ Above recommended (aggressive growth) |
| **YouTube** | 1 video/week + 1–3 Shorts/week | 3 shorts + 1 medium/day + 1 video/week | ⚠️ Shorts above recommended |
| **Instagram** | 3–5 posts/week | 2 shorts/day + 1 medium/week + 1 video/week | ⚠️ Slightly above recommended |
| **LinkedIn** | 2–5 posts/week | 1 medium/day (7/week) | ⚠️ Above recommended (but within growth tier) |
| **X** | 3–5 posts/day | 4 shorts + 1 medium = 5/day | ✅ Within recommended range |

> **Note:** Our schedule is intentionally on the higher end because vidpipe automates content creation, eliminating the burnout factor that limits manual posting. The key constraint is content **quality**, not production capacity. Monitor engagement metrics and dial back if engagement per post drops.
